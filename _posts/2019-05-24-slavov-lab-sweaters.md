The [Slavov Lab](http://slavovlab.net) recently got some embroidered team sweaters, so I decided to rework our [old logo design](https://atchen.me/design/2017/01/05/slavov-lab-logo.html) with the help of some of my colleagues (s.o. to Annie Schide for the beautiful ribosomes!)

[Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu) recently got a [brand-new re-branding](https://www.upstatement.com/work/northeastern-brand/), from the great designers over at [Upstatement](https://www.upstatement.com/). My first attempts at a sweater-friendly logo were closely led by [Northeastern's Brand Book](https://brand.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/NU_Brand_Book_digital.pdf).

## Typography

Some vanilla stuff, based on the strict guidelines in the brand book:

## Lab Branding

We next decided to try to incorporate our rainbow colors from last round

For the second row here, I followed the advice of my friend [Mike](http://michaelrascati.com) and saturated/darkened some of the lighter colors.

It also doesn't look bad stacked vertically:

## Ribosomes!

Our lab likes ribosomes, so we decided to try to make a graphic out of a bunch of them translating on an mRNA!

Getting our ribosomes to look less like birds on a power line...

And finally, our design on different backgrounds:
