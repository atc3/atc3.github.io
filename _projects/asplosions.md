Asplosions was a game I made for [Ludum Dare 21](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/). [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a tri-annual game development competition where developers have 48 hours to complete a video game, from scratch (tools/libraries allowed).

The game has the player escape hordes of sumo wrestlers by blasting, or building their way through each consecutive level. The game won 6th in fun and 60th overall from over 600 entrants!

The game was written from scratch in [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) and [Actionscript3](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/learning.html).
